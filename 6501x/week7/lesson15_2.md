# Optimization Continued
- How it's used in statistics
  - Want to determine coefficients to minimize some error term
  - Done for linear regression, lasso regression (adds a constriant on sum of coefficeints), ridge (adds a constraint on sum of squared coefs), and elastic net (adds both constraints)
