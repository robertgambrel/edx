## Shelf Space Optimization
- Hypotheses:
  - More shelf space leads to more sales
  - More sales lead to more complementary product sales
  - Larger effect if complementary products are adjacent
- Optimize shelf space
  - How much for each product type?
  - Constraints:
    - min and max amounts per product
    - total space in store
- Ignore product promotions, payments for space
- How to measure the effects (get baseline?)
- How to determine whether the effect exists at all?
- Are hypotheses true?
- What data is needed?
