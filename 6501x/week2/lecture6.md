# Change detection
- Determine whether something has changed (usually w/ time series data)
    - Do we need to take action to correct course?
    - Did past action change how things went?
- Have to balance false positives vs under-counting changes
    - using traditional hypothesis tests might require so much data that by the time you have enough, it's too late to re-adjust the change
