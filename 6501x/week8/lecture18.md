# First case - Power Company
- Some customers don't pay bills (could pay but don't)
- Want to turn their power off
  - But only want to target those who will never pay, period
  - NOT those who just forgot or fell behind but want to dig out
- Logistical problems - have more people to shut off each month than people available
  - Need to do a manual shut off
  - Workers must go to location, takes time
  - More work than the company can handle
- Which shutoffs should be done each month, given capacity constraints?
- Some of the capacity (worker's time) is used by travel. Schedule accordingly (close together)
- Some shutoffs shouldn't be done at all - how do you identify those?
- How should you prioritize shutoffs?
- Think about data you need, models to use
  - Different approaches
  - Use output of one into input of another
  - Can't tell whether it works, unless tested on real data (don't worry about that)
