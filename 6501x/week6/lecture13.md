# Queuing
- If you know something fits a probability distribution, how can you model it?
- If you have an auto-dialer that puts people in a queue if they pick up, how many phone operators do you need?
  - Based on answer rate, and length of call to finish
- If the pickup is poisson w/ parameter lambda, and the length of call is exponential with mu, you an calculate:
  - Expected fracion of time the employee is busy
  - Expected waiting time a caller faces if they pick up
  - Expected # of calls in the queue
